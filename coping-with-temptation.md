# Coping with Temptation

When we speak of expecting the problem it's not a request to become excessively conscious of potential issues. Rather we speak of expecting the problem as a means of introducing the potential dangers that Christians face in this world.

Instead of being surprised and bewildered when trials come how should we react?

> **12** Beloved, do not _think it strange_\[xenizo\] concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; **13** but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ's sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy.  
> 1 Peter 4:12-13 NKJV

> Luke 17:1 \(NKJV\) 1 Then He said to the disciples, â€œIt is impossible that no offenses should come, but woe to him through whom they do come!

As Christians we should react to _persecution_ by:

* **rejoicing** that we are privileged to suffer with Christ
  * remember how the Apostle Peter denied Jesus? He has lived to tell the tale. Peter couldn't partake of Christ's suffering as the Lord was arrested by the Roman soldiers.
  * Apostle Peter's thinking had changed after that incident where he had twice denied the Lord Jesus because he couldn't bear to suffer for Christ. Some of us have compromised when under trial because of our faulty thinking patterns.
* **reveling** in the inexpressible joy we shall have when Christ is revealed in glory\(Homework READ: 2 Corinthians 4:16-18\)

Who is the Apostle speaking to?

* _The Apostle Peter was speaking to the fiercely persecuted Jewish believers struggling in the midst of trials. These Jews were persecuted for their new found faith in Christ._

* They were God's chosen people who were living as foreigners in a different land

> "Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the pilgrims\(temporal residents\) of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,"  
> 1 Peter 1:1 NKJV

* Roman provinces in modern day Turkey

Beloved, **change your thinking** about how you perceive the trials of life.

> The Apostle wants us to understand that a healthy thinking pattern will result in a positive consequence.

In what way does the Apostle intend for us to change our thinking? What kind of mindset does he wants us to adopt?

* _do not think it strange_ meaning do not think it's a foreign concept to undergo challenges
* _do not think it strange_:_ _
* * when the world hates you

Nothing stops us from being surprised or bewildered. This is natural. For instance, when a balloon bursts it frightens the unsuspecting despite being aware of the effect it can have.

### Why Should We React This Way?

> "**12** Beloved, _**do not think it strange**_ concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; **13** but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ's sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy."  
> 1 Peter 4:12-13 NKJV

> "If we **endure**, we shall also reign with Him. If we deny Him, He also will deny us." 2 Timothy 2:12 NKJV



### The Promises of God

> "For _all the promises of God in Him are Yes_, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God through us."  
> 2 Corinthians 1:20 NKJV
