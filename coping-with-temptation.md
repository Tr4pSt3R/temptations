# When Trials Come

Instead of being surprised and bewildered when trials come how should we react?

> **12** Beloved, do not {think it strange}\[xenizo\] concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange\* thing happened to you; **13** but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ's sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy.  
> 1 Peter 4:12-13 NKJV

Who is the Apostle speaking to? 

Beloved, change your thinking about how you perceive the trials of life.

In what way does the Apostle intend for us to change our thinking? What kind of mindset does he wants us to adopt? 

* _do not think it strange_ meaning do not think it's a foreign concept to undergo challenges
* _do not think it strange_ if you are a mother and you

Nothing stops us from being surprised or bewildered. This is natural. For instance, when a balloon bursts it frightens the unsuspecting despite being aware of the effect it can have.
