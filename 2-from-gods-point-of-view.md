# The Children of Israel Tested

## Introduction

God puts us in situations which allows Him, ourselves and others to see what is in our hearts. We can be tested individually as seen in the example of the patriarch Abraham. Nonetheless, the Lord GOD also tests a people-group to establish their corporate faith in Him.

At this point, our language has subtly changed from using temptation to describe God's dealings with us to using the word test. This should remove any confusion between the two although great efforts have been made to distinguish between the two.

> “Then the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and _gather a certain quota every day_, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not.” \(Exodus 16:4 NKJV\)

1. What was the simple test did God put the children of Israel through?
   * trust of God's providence
   * Timeline
     * Moses is visited by God at the burning bush \(Exo. 3:1-22\)
     * God discusses His rescue mission \(Exo. 3:8\) and His ultimate plan to pluck the children of Israel\(descendants of Jacob\) from Egypt to _a land flowing with milk and honey_\(Exo 3:8\).
     * The LORD God Almighty, El Shaddai, showed His power by raining down ten plagues upon Egypt which weakened Pharaoh's resistance.
     * God successfully liberates the children of Israel and sparks a term now used in popular phrase to describe the movement of a great number of people - the Exodus!
     * God made a way through the wilderness when their backs were against the wall and there was no way out.
     * After successfully crossing the Red Sea the wilderness journey now truly begins.
     * Bitter waters were made sweet at Marah \(Exo. 15:22-25\)

### Providence

* **Providence** means _God's continual care over His creation_. God uses tests to teach us to trust Him in everything. He started with the most pressing concerns, which was _physical nourishment_. God doesn't tempt us, but tests us through practical concerns that affect our lives. 
* Egypt's plenty...
  * Whereas, Egypt had stored for themselves seven years’ worth of grain in the time of great worldwide famine the children of Israel had to simply trust Jehovah Jireh for provision.
  * they departed from Egypt with gold and silver in large quantities, but not enough food or water to sustain them and their animals

1. Why did God test the children of Israel?

   * “that I may test them _whether they will walk in My law or not_.” \(Exodus 16:4c NKJV\)
     * walking in God's law indicates that they love Him
       * "if you walk in my commandments
     * refusing to walk in God's law shows that they are contrary to Him

2. Why did God test His people for forty years in the wilderness?

   > "And you shall remember that the LORD your God led you all the way these forty years in the wilderness, _**to humble you**_ and test you _**to know what was in your heart**_, whether you _**would keep His commandments or not**_." \(Deuteronomy 8:2 NKJV\)

   * it was a series of lessons that took forty years to teach!

We now jump from the wilderness episode to another event. The relationship between the God of Abraham and Abraham's descendants at best is an almighty wrestling. God is wrestling to win their hearts whilst the children of Israel are hopelessly disjointed in their efforts to act right.

Our next topic focuses on further tests by the LORD God for the congregation of the wilderness. The link between the wilderness test and the commands to abstain from false prophets will become clear by the end of this study.

1. Why does God allow false prophets and false doctrines? \(Deu. 13:1-3\)

   > “**1** If there arises among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams, and he gives you a sign or a wonder,"  
   > **2** and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, “Let us go after other gods’—which you have not known—‘and let us serve them,’  
   > **3** you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams, for the Lord your God is testing you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. \(Deuteronomy 13:1-3 NKJV\)

   * the LORD God is testing obedience to the first commandment - "_You shall have no other gods before Me._" \(Exodus 20:3 NKJV\)

   * false prophet

   * a carrier of divine messages and warnings which are not from the LORD God

1. Why did God eventually allow some heathen nations to stay in the promised land? \(Jdg. 2:20-22\)
   > "**20** Then the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel; and He said, “Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not heeded My voice, **21** I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died, **22** so that through them I may test Israel, whether they will keep the ways of the Lord, to walk in them as their fathers kept them, or not.” \(Judges 2:20-22 NKJV\)
