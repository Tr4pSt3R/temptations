# The Children of Israel Tested
## Introduction
God puts us in situations which allows Him, ourselves and others to see what is in our hearts. We can be tested individually as seen in the example of the patriarch Abraham. Nonetheless, the Lord GOD also tests a people-group to establish their corporate faith in Him.

>“Then the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and _gather a certain quota every day_, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not.” (Exodus 16:4 NKJV)


1. What was the simple test did God put the children of Israel through?
  - trust of God's providence
  - **Providence** means God's continual care over His creation. God uses tests to teach us to trust Him in everything. He started with the most pressing concerns which was _physical nourishment_. God doesn't tempt us, but tests us through practical concerns that affect our lives. 
  - God was not testing children
    - Whereas, Egypt had to stored for themselves seven years’ worth of grain in the time of great worldwide famine the children of Israel had to simply trust Jehovah Jireh for provision
    - they departed from Egypt with gold and silver in large quantities, but not enough food or water to sustain them and their animals

b. Why did God test the children of Israel?
  - “that I may test them *whether they will walk in My law or not*.” (Exodus 16:4c NKJV)
    - walking in God's law indicates that they love Him
    - refusing to walk in God's law shows that they are contrary to Him

c. Why did God prove/test His people for forty years in the wilderness (Deu. 8:2)?
  — to know what was in your heart

d. Why does God allow false prophets/false doctrines? (Deu. 13:1-3)

e. Why did God eventually allow some heathen nations to stay in the promised land? (Jdg. 2:20-22)
