# Example of Temptation: Noah

### Promise

> "**17** And behold, I Myself am bringing floodwaters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die.  
> **18** But **I will establish My covenant with you**\(Gen. 9:9-17\); and you shall go into the ark—you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you."  
> Genesis 6:17-18 NKJV

Question: What was God's promise to Noah?

* God promised to **establish His covenant** with Noah

### Principle

> "Make yourself an ark of gopherwood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and outside with pitch."  
> Genesis 6:14 NKJV

Question: What was Noah commanded to do?

* Noah made an ark of gopherwood

### Problem

> "By faith Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his household, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith."  
> Hebrews 11:7 NKJV

How was Noah's faith tested?

* **Noah had confidence in God and His word**. Every promise we receive from God will undergo this test; do you have confidence in God and His word? If our spirit, actions, choices, obedience and prayers does not meaningfully express our faith in God and His word of promise we will never receive of God's promise. 
  > "And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”  
  > Matthew 21:22 NKJV
* Noah believed in the divine warning without seeking for physical evidence to quicken him to action. This is the very definition of faith - "_the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen_."\(Heb. 11:1\). **Noah did not seek physical sign and wonders to quicken him to action.**
* Noah had no immediate concern over where he was going to source the raw materials for such a large construction. It's unthinkable to imagine how a nomadic, tent-dwelling people group could embark on ship-building. **Noah had to something that's never been done before **employing skills he's probably never used before. 

### The Provision

God fulfills the promise if we will keep believing and wait for His timing.

> "**1 **So **God blessed\(empowered/authorised\) Noah and his sons**, and said to them: “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. **9** And as for Me, behold, **I establish\(accomplish/confirm/continue/make good/raise up/\) My covenant with you and with your descendants after you**,"  
> Genesis 9:1, 9 NKJV

What did God give Noah?

* God established\(_accomplished/confirmed/continued/made good/raised up_\) a** covenant**\(binding agreement/solemn promise\)** **with Noah; meaning a binding agreement or solemn promise. 
* "_Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth_." \(v1b\) This is a second occurence of this covenant demand. It was first given to Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. 
* All human life perished. Every soul under the Sun was wiped out through the great flood. It was a total annihilation of all life forms on earth.
* Noah and his family were uniquely preserved by God. 

Promises:

The word "promise" primarily denotes a proclamation or an announcement a gracious benefit from God. Notice how it's not something

1. Threat of flooding

   > "I Myself am bringing floodwaters on the earth," \(Genesis 6:16a NKJV\)

   * this is **damning**_ threat_ to the sinful people of Noah's generation
   * but, a **sweet**_ promise_ to Noah and his family and all livestock which accompanied them into the ark 
   * this is same promise that we have in Christ. 
   * Christ is the head of the new generation who have been made heirs of righteousness through faith
   * The perverse generation of wicked men who do whatever they want without a care for God's threats will be overtaking by the great flood of God's fiery wrath
   * However, those of us who have ceased from working all manner of uncleaness, repented of our sins, turned our back on the perverse generation, picked up our cross and followed Jesus into the 'ark' will also receive this promise. 

2. Threat of total annihilation of all living things on earth  
   &gt; "to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life;" \(Genesis 6:16b NKJV\)

   * Today, I appeal to your minds to make the conscious decision to jump on the ark if you haven't done so.   
   * Jump back into the ark and stay in the ark permanently until the overflowing sewage of wickedness and evil has been swept away. 

3. I Myself am bringing floodwaters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die. **18** But **I will establish My covenant with you**\(Gen. 9:9-17\); and you shall go into the ark—you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you."

**Prayer - Sat. 11th March 2017**

1. Father of all flesh and every creeping thing. You are My LORD and God. I pray that Your children will **save** themselves from this perverse, wicked and untoward generation.
