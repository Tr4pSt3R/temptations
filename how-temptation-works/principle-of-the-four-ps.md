# How Temptation Works

* God gives us a **PROMISE**
* which has with a **PRINCIPLE** \(or condition we must fulfil
* and follows this by a **PROBLEM** to test/tempt us. 
* and then comes God's **PROVISION** \(if we stay faithful during the problem\)

Many of us don't have what it takes to stand in faith. To fight until the victory is assured. To pray until the promise is procured. To strive until the race is won. To praise until the garment of heaviness is lifted. To live in purity. To abstain from the accursed materials.

Through temptation what we lack in ability, might, strength, faith and the fruits of the Spirit is gradually introduced to us. This is, by no means, the exhaustive list of the benefits of temptation. The manifold wisdom of God measures just what we can bear. This means every test is a stepping stone the next level of our faith. Thus, temptation provides a suitable occasion for gauging our ability, might, power, strength and faith. When we stand firm in the test our strength is made clear to us. We become convinced of the power of God in our possession. When we fail in the test our lack of strength is made apparent to ourselves.

# The Promise

The **Promise** is a '_rhema_' \(a personal, quickened word of God\). It may come through the Bible, a sermon, a prophecy, God speaking to our hearts, etc.

# The Principle

God may make a specific condition when He gives us the promise, but often what He requires of us is faith and patience.

> "that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those _**who through faith and patience inherit the promises**_."  
> Hebrews 6:12 NKJV

# The Problem

What God has promised may seem to be an impossible _test of faith_. God may delay giving us what He has promised. This is a _test of patience_.

# The Provision

God fulfils the promise if we will keep believing and wait for His timing.

# Example of Temptation: Noah

### Promise

> "**17** And behold, I Myself am bringing floodwaters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die.  
> **18** But **I will establish My covenant with you**\(Gen. 9:9-17\); and you shall go into the ark—you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you."  
> Genesis 6:17-18 NKJV

Question: What was God's promise to Noah?

* God promised to **establish His covenant** with Noah

### Principle

> "Make yourself an ark of gopherwood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and outside with pitch."  
> Genesis 6:14 NKJV

Question: What was Noah commanded to do?

* Noah made an ark of gopherwood

### Problem

> "By faith Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his household, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith."  
> Hebrews 11:7 NKJV

How was Noah's faith tested?

* **Noah had confidence in God and His word**. Every promise we receive from God will undergo this test; do you have confidence in God and His word? If our spirit, actions, choices, obedience and prayers does not meaningfully express our faith in God and His word of promise we will never receive of God's promise. 
  > "And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”  
  > Matthew 21:22 NKJV
* Noah believed in the divine warning without seeking for physical evidence to quicken him to action. This is the very definition of faith - "_the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen_."\(Heb. 11:1\). **Noah did not seek physical sign and wonders to quicken him to action.**
* Noah had no immediate concern over where he was going to source the raw materials for such a large construction. It's unthinkable to imagine how a nomadic, tent-dwelling people group could embark on ship-building. **Noah had to something that's never been done before**.

### The Provision

God fulfills the promise if we will keep believing and wait for His timing.

> "**1 **So **God blessed Noah and his sons**, and said to them: “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. **9** And as for Me, behold, **I establish My covenant with you and with your descendants after you**,"  
> Genesis 9:1, 9 NKJV

What did God give Noah?

* God gave Noah an **eternal covenant**
