# Example of Temptation: Abraham

## Introduction

Yet again we have another great example of temptation concerning the patriarch Abraham. This shows that as God's man he went through much afflictions\(Psalm 32:19\) _as is expected of all God's elect_\(Daniel 11:35\). Abraham is a man who's faith and confidence in God is an example worthy of emulation for believers everywhere. No wonder Abraham is called the _father of faith_. I **pray** that we learn of the kind of substance that strengthened Abraham's confidence and personal trust in God. Abraham's faith is worthy of imitating\(following/aspiring to\).

As believers, our confidence in Christ and personal faith in Him is crucial to being able to stand or falling away.

God promised father Abraham a son but the promise we will be focusing on Today is entirely different.

> **8** By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called\(_by_ El-Shaddai\) to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. **9** By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents\(as nomads\) with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise; **10** for he waited\(expectant/confidently\) for the \(eternal/heavenly\) city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.  
> Hebrews 11:8-10 NKJV

## Promise

What did God promise Abraham?_ El Shaddai, the Almighty God promised to give father Abraham a land._

This promise is variously stated in Genesis 12:1; 13:14-17; 15:18; 17:1-14; 22:15-18. The enduring promise was ultimately the same; "**I will give you the land of the Gentiles**".

> "**1 **Now the Lord had said to Abram: 'Get out of your country, from your family and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you."  
> Genesis 12:1 NKJV
>
> "**14** And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him: “Lift your eyes now and look from the place where you are—northward, southward, eastward, and westward; **15** _for all the land which you see I give to you and your descendants forever_. **16** And I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth; so that if a man could number the dust of the earth, then your descendants also could be numbered. **17** _Arise, walk in the land through its length and its width, for I give it to you_.”"  
> Genesis 13:14-17 NKJV
>
> "**18** On the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying:“_To your descendants I have given this land_, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the River Euphrates— **19** the Kenites, the Kenezzites, the Kadmonites, **20** the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, **21** the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”"  
> Genesis 15:18-21 NKJV
>
> "Also _I give to you and your descendants after you the land in which you are a stranger_, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”  
> Genesis 17:8 NKJV

The land of the Canaanites \(Genesis 12:6-7\).

## Principle

What was the principle/condition? _The main condition for the fulfilment was **faith**! Father Abraham had to believe that God, who had called him out of extraordinarily difficult circumstances, was able to perform just what He promised._

The usual way to gain a land is often through buying with money or conquering through war**. **However, father Abraham had to please El-Shaddai through **faith** and exercise **patience**.

## Problem

A problem represents an occasion which provides the opportunity of success or failure. Approval from God comes as a direct result of our reaction to the problem, temptation or trial we face.

In the case of Abraham, what was the problem?

* The patriarch Abraham went out not knowing where he was going.

* challenged by his nephew Lot \(Genesis 13:11-13\)

  * Father Abraham's stayed in land of Canaan when Lot made demands for all "_the plains of Jordan"_. Abraham did not depart from Canaan for he knew that that was his promised land

## Provision

> **42** For He remembered His holy promise, and Abraham His servant. **43** He brought out His people with joy, His chosen ones with gladness. **44** He gave them the lands of the Gentiles, and they inherited the labour of the nations,  
> Psalms 105:42-44 NKJV

The promises God made with father Abraham is an enduring promise that has an effect on all believers up to Today. READ Galatians 3:15-18

# Summary

1. Faith and patience are key conditionals for obtaining the promise of God.
2. The promises of God are "yes" and "Amen" through faith in Christ.

# Prayers

1. El-Shaddai, God Almighty, nothing pleases you more than when Your children wait with faith and patience for the fulfilment of Your  exceedingingly great and many promises. Holy Father increase our faith and establish our feet in the land of promise. In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour. Amen!
2. I pray, Father, let the love of You prevail in the hearts of Your children. We love because You first loved us. We love You much because You have forgiven us much. O Holy Father, great is Your praise in this matter. 
3. Spirit of God make the love of God more apparent before Your children. Let Your revelation conclude with a deeper intimacy with the Divine Father.
