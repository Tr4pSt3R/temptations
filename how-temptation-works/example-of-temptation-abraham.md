# Example of Temptation: Abraham

## Introduction

Yet again we have another great example of temptation concerning the patriarch Abraham. This shows that as God's man he went through much afflictions. Abraham is a man who's faith and confidence in God is an example worthy of emulation for all believers everywhere. No wonder Abraham is called the _father of faith_. I **pray** that we learn of the kind of substance that strengthened Abraham's confidence and personal trust in God. Abraham's faith is worthy of imitating\(following/aspiring to\).

> **8** By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called\(_by_ El-Shaddai\) to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. **9** By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents\(as nomads\) with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise; **10** for he waited\(expectant/confidently\) for the \(eternal/heavenly\) city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.  
> Hebrews 11:8-10 NKJV
