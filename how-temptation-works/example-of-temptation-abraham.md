# Example of Temptation: Abraham

## Introduction

Yet again we have another great example of temptation concerning the patriarch Abraham. This shows that as God's man he went through much afflictions. Abraham is a man who's faith and confidence in God is an example worthy of emulation for believers everywhere. No wonder Abraham is called the _father of faith_. I **pray** that we learn of the kind of substance that strengthened Abraham's confidence and personal trust in God. Abraham's faith is worthy of imitating\(following/aspiring to\).

God promised father Abraham a son but the promise we will be focusing on Today is entirely different.

> **8** By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called\(_by_ El-Shaddai\) to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. **9** By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents\(as nomads\) with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise; **10** for he waited\(expectant/confidently\) for the \(eternal/heavenly\) city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.  
> Hebrews 11:8-10 NKJV

## Promise

What did God promise Abraham?_ El Shaddai, the Almighty God promised to give father Abraham a land._

This promise is variously stated in Genesis 12:1-3; 13:14-17; 15:18; 17:1-14; 22:15-18. The enduring promise was ultimately the same; "I will give you the land of the Gentiles".   
  
The land of the Canaanites \(Genesis 12:6-7\). 

## Principle

What was the principle/condition? _The main condition for the fulfilment was faith! Father Abraham had to believe that God, who had called him out of extraordinary difficult circumstances, was able to perform just what He promised._

The usual way to gain a land is often through buying with money or conquering through war**. **However, father Abraham had to please El-Shaddai through **faith** and exercise **patience**.

## Problem

A problem represents an occasion which provides the opportunity of success or failure.   
What was the problem?

* The patriarch Abraham went out not knowing where he was going.

* challenged by his nephew Lot \(Genesis 13:11-13\)
  * Father Abraham's stayed in land of Canaan when Lot made demands for all "_the plains of Jordan"_. Abraham did not depart from Canaan for he knew that that was his promised land

## Provision

> **42** For He remembered His holy promise, and Abraham His servant. **43** He brought out His people with joy, His chosen ones with gladness. **44** He gave them the lands of the Gentiles, and they inherited the labour of the nations,  
> Psalms 105:42-44 NKJV

The promises God made with father Abraham is an enduring promise that has an effect on all believers up to Today. READ Galatians 3:15-18

# Summary

1. Faith and patience are key conditionals for obtaining the promise of God.
2. The promises of God are "yes" and "Amen" through faith in Christ

# Prayer

1. El-Shaddai, God Almighty, nothing pleases you more than when Your children wait with faith and patience for the fulfilment of Your  exceedingingly great and many promises. Holy Father increase our faith and establish our feet in the land of promise. In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour. Amen!
