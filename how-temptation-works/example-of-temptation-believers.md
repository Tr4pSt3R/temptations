## Promise

The promise of God to all believers is that we won't be ruled by death, but we will _reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ._

> "For if by the one man's offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will _reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ_."  
> Romans 5:17 NKJV

What does it mean to be "ruled by death"?  
  - to be controlled by the passions and the lusts of the flesh  
  - to live and be controlled by the carnal mind \(Rom. 8:6\)  
  - to live under the dominion of sin \(Rom. 6:12\)

Notes

* every action, deed and thoughts that belongs to our former lives can be properly classified as **dead works**. 
* every action of the past life was passionately pursued with the aim of fulfilling some desire of the flesh. 
* every deed of the past life was carried out to expand our advantage in the world fairly or unfairly. Therefore, nothing was done with God's glory as the chief aim. 
* every thought was futile, foolish and filthy. 
* All these are actions that comes naturally to the man or woman who is "_dead in trespasses and sins_"\(Eph. 2:5\)

The promise is that the foundation and basis for the believer's rulership will be through Christ Jesus. 

## Principle

> "**4** Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we shall walk in newness of life. **11** Likewise you also, reckon\(_consider_\) yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord."  
> Romans 6:4, 11 NKJV

What principle\(_condition_\) is the believer to live by in order to obtain\(_realise_\) the promise of _reigning in life through the One, Jesus Christ?_

* Buried with Christ through baptism into death
  * do we understand the proper and significant reasons for baptism?
