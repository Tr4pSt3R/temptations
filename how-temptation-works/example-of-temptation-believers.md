# Example of Temptation: Believers

## Promise

The promise of God to all believers is that we won't be ruled by death, but we will _reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ._

> "For if by the one\(Adam\) man's offense\(_lapse, deviation, willful transgression, fall, fault, sin, trespass_\) death reigned through the one\(Adam\), much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the \(_free_\) gift of righteousness will _reign in life _\[_**eternal**_\]_ through the One, Jesus Christ_."  
> Romans 5:17 NKJV

One man messed up. Another man fixed things up.

There are two rulers vying for the kingdom of every human heart. The natural man has no choice in the matter. Death is the true king of the heart of the natural\(_unbelieving_/_unregenerate_/_not born again_\) man. Death has the upper hand. The fall of the head of the human race, Adam, forfeited\(lost/gave up/surrendered\) power over death to Satan. Whilst Adam was without sin he was above death. Adam's transgression changed the order of dominion. As a direct result all his posterity\(_descendants_\) have been servants of death, dominated by sin.

Nevertheless, the tyrannical rulership of death will end! The good news is that the regenerate believer, by God's grace, can completely cut ties with the old king, death. This is best pictured by how the enslaved children of Israel were wonderfully rescued by the Merciful God of Jacob. This is the very heart of the promise, removing death as our ruler and enstooling Jesus Christ as Lord of our lives; throning Him as King.

#### What is Grace?

Grace \_kharis, \_the divine influence upon the heart., and its reflection in our life.

> "For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,"  
> Titus 2:11 NKJV

What does it mean to be "ruled by death"?

* to be controlled by the passions and the lusts of the flesh
  > "**1** Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind, for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, **2** that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God. **3** For we have spent enough of our past lifetime in doing the will of the Gentilesâ€”when we walked in lewdness, lusts, drunkenness, revelries, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries."  
  > 1 Peter 4:1-3 NKJV
* to live and be controlled by the carnal mind
  > "For _to be carnally minded is death_, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace."  
  > Romans 8:6 NKJV
* to live under the dominion of sin
  > "Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts."  
  > Romans 6:12 NKJV

Notes

* every action, deed and thoughts that belongs to our former lives can be properly classified as **dead works**. 
* every action of the past life was passionately pursued with the aim of fulfilling some desire of the flesh. 
* every deed of the past life was carried out to expand our advantage in the world fairly or unfairly. Therefore, nothing was done with God's glory as the chief aim. 
* every thought was futile, foolish and filthy. 
* All these are actions that comes naturally to the man or woman who is "_dead in trespasses\(sins\)_"\(Eph. 2:5\)

The promise is that the foundation and basis for the believer's rulership will be through Christ Jesus.\(TODO_: expand on this topic or remove\)_

## Principle

> "**4** Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we shall walk in newness of life. **11** Likewise you also, reckon\(_consider_\) yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord."  
> Romans 6:4, 11 NKJV

Conditions for Reigning

What principle\(_condition_\) is the believer to live by in order to obtain\(_realise_\) the promise of _reigning in life through the One, Jesus Christ?_

* Buried with Christ through baptism into death
  * do we understand the proper and significant reasons for baptism?

# Problem

There's a problem between the spirit-man and the flesh \(old nature, natural man\).

"For I know that in me \(that is in my _flesh_\) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but how to perform what is good I do not find. **22** For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man."  
Romans 7:18, 22 NKJV

# Provision

> "Yet in _**all**_ these things **we are more than conquerors** through Him who loved us."  
> Romans 8:37 NKJV

Through Adam we lived as captives/slaves of sin.  
Through Christ Jesus we are captives over sin.

## Summary

1. No body can achieve the stand of God \(James 1:22-25\)
2. The word of God is the mirror of God
3. Christ's love makes us more than conquerors over every temptation

## Prayers

1. Father, cleanse us of all enmity proceeding from our carnal hearts. 
2. Give us grace that we may walk in the newness of life
