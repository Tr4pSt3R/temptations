# Learning Objectives

* understand the imagery of "the refiner's fire" as a means of purification

# The Refiner's Fire

## Introduction

By putting us to the test, God purifies us just as silver or gold is purified in a refiner's crucible. The purification process of precious metals is a fitting analogy to describe how God is dealing with our lives to produce a masterpiece and true workmanship\(Eph. 2:10\)  of His hand.

Man was created in the image of God. The perfect image of God in man was ruined as a result of the fall of Adam which, has affected all who are of the lineage of Adam.

The refining process is a means of restoration.

## Refined as Silver

In Psalm 66:10, the believer's experience is likened to the refinery process of silver.

> "For You, O God, have tested us; _You have refined us as silver is refined_." Psalm 66:10 NKJV

Precious metals are rarely discovered in their original state of usefulness. The raw material of silver is a combination of ore and the precious metal.

Define "ore"

* "a naturally occuring solid material from which a material or valuable mineral can be extracted profitably."

When you see silver ore you are unlikely to think much of it. It's very likely that, with our untrained eye, we will pass it by. In it's natural state ore is unprofitable and of little use. Likewise, man in his natural state is of little use to God for an effective work of ministry.

## The Furnace of Affliction

The Maker refines men in the _**furnace of affliction**_.

> "Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the _furnace of affliction_."  
> Isaiah 48:10 NKJV

Define "furnace"

* an enclosed structure in which material can be heated to very high temperatures, e.g. for smelting metals.

### Difference between Refining and Purifying

define "refining"

* removing impurities

Define "purifying"

* removing contaminants
* to make pure; free from anything that debases, pollutes, adulterates, or contaminates: to purify metals. See more.

The furnace of affliction speaks about testing situations. These sitatutions tends to be uncomfortable, inconvenient, challenging, hard, intolerable, painful, awkward, uneasy, etc. These situations are not usually easy to quit from. The Apostle Paul sets out testing situations which are common to most Christians around the world:

* patience
  * endurance in hard or difficult situations
* long-suffering
  * situations which demands that we bear lovingly with one another even if they are difficult. 
  * this could be in terms of: dealing with a child with behaviour issues; an unreasonable line manager at work etc. \(_this is a furnace, an enclosed structure_\). The child cannot be disowned. The job cannot be packed in. Most employment contracts cannot be terminated with immediate effect \(some takes up to six months!\)
* tribulations
  * various troubles
* needs
  * lack of the basics necessary to support life
* distresses
  * > "And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, _**a thorn in the flesh**_ was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure."  
    > 2 Corinthians 12:7 NKJV
* stripes
  * suffering for doing no wrong
  * insulted for being a Christian
    > "But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people's matters."  
    > 1 Peter 4:15 NKJV
  * insulted for being a Christian
* imprisonments
  * wrongful imprisonment
  * hated without a cause
* tumults
  * protests and riots against Christ
* labours
* sleeplessness
* fasting

This passage tells us what the Lord tests in the furnace of affliction.

> "Fire tests the purity of silver and gold,  
> but the Lord tests the heart."  
> Proverbs 17:3 NLT

* us: _His children_

In these situations we are usually confronted with choices which will either promote God's glory in our lives or tarnish our reputation bringing shame and reproach.

> "For My own sake, for My own sake, I will do it;  
>  **For how should my My name be profaned**?  
>  _And I will not give my glory to another_."  
>  Isaiah 48:11 NKJV

### Examples of a Furnace

* Egypt
* Babylonian
* even Jerusalem!

The LORD is determined to purge us of the impurities of our heart. It doesn't matter whether we change jobs, church, supermarket, friends, girlfriend/boyfriend, husband/wife, etc. **The Father will continue the process until we are in the image of Christ.    
** We cannot be legitimately called His children if we do not permit Him to have any involvement in our upbringing.

> "But **if you are without chastening**, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons."  
> Hebrews 12:8 NKJV

### Israel in the Furnace

READ: Ezekiel 22:17-22

* the Lord said this of Israel, nonetheless, it is just as applicable to Christians of Today

## Peace for the Refined

God's peace is the reward for successfully passing through the processing in the furnace of affliction.

> "Oh, that you had heeded my commandments! Then your **peace** _would have been like a river_, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea."  
> Isaiah 48:18 NKJV

## Manifold Trials

> "In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved\(_distressed_\) by various trials, that **the genuineness of your faith**, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honour and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ."  
> 1 Peter 1:6, 7 NKJV

## Summary

1. The furnace of affliction are orchestrated by God.
2. The refining process is God-ordained.
3. No matter where we go, **The Father will continue the process of refining until we are in the image of Christ.**
