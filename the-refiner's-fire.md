# Learning Objectives

* understand the imagery of "the refiner's fire" as a means of purification

# The Refiner's Fire

## Introduction

By putting us to the test, God purifies us just as silver or gold is purified in a refiner's crucible. The purification process of precious metals is a fitting analogy to describe how God is dealing with our lives to produce a masterpiece and true workmanship\(Eph. 2:10\)  of His hand.

## Refined as Silver

In Psalm 66:10, the believer's experience is likened to the refinery process of silver.

> "For You, O God, have tested us; _You have refined us as silver is refined_." Psalm 66:10 NKJV

Precious metals are rarely discovered in their original state of usefulness. The raw material is a combination of ore and the precious metal.

Define "ore"

* "a naturally occuring solid material from which a material or valuable mineral can be extracted profitably."

In it's natural state ore is unprofitable and of little use. Likewise, man in their natural state is of little use to God.

## The Furnace of Affliction

The Maker refines men in the _**furnace of affliction**_.

> "Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the \_furnace of affliction."  
> \_Isaiah 48:10 NKJV

The furnace of affliction speaks about testing situations. These sitatutions tends to be uncomfortable, inconvenient, challenging, hard, intolerable, painful, awekward, uneasy,

In these situations we are usually confronted with choices which will either promote God's glory in our lives or tarnish our reputation.

> "For My own sake, for My own sake, I will do it; **For how should my My name be profaned**? _And I will not give my glory to another_."
>
> Isaiah 48:11 NKJV

## Peace for the Refined

God's peace is the reward for successfully passing through the processing in the furnace of affliction. 

> "Oh, that you had heeded my commandments! Then your **peace** _would have been like a river_, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea."
>
> Isaiah 48:18 NKJV

## Manifold Trials

> "In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved\(_distressed_\) by various trials, that **the genuineness of your faith**, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honour, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
>
> 1 Peter 1:6, 7 NKJV

It's unusual to contemplate that 

## Prayers - Refining - Tues. 31st Jan. 2017

1. I declare that I am the work of Your hands, O Father and Maker of all things, both visible and invisible.
2. Lord Jesus, we stand to win the crown of life if we stand firm in faith until the very end. In this we ask for Your divine aid to assure our hearts and keep the reward of the **Crown of Life** in view.
