# How Temptation Works

* God gives us a **PROMISE**
* which has with it a **PRINCIPLE** \(or condition we must fulfill\)
* and follows this by a **PROBLEM** to test/tempt us. 
* and then comes God's **PROVISION** \(if we stay faithful during the problem\)

Many of us don't have what it takes to stand in faith. To fight until the victory is assured. To pray until the promise is procured. To strive until the race is won. To praise until the garment of heaviness is lifted. To live in purity. To abstain from the accursed materials.

Through temptation what we lack in ability, might, strength, faith and the fruits of the Spirit is gradually introduced to us. This is, by no means, the exhaustive list of the benefits of temptation. The manifold wisdom of God measures just what we can bear. This means every test is a stepping stone the next level of our faith. Thus, temptation provides a suitable occasion for gauging our ability, might, power, strength and faith. When we stand firm in the test our strength is made clear to us. We become convinced of the power of God in our possession. When we fail in the test our lack of strength is made apparent to ourselves.

# The Promise

The **Promise** is a '_rhema_' \(a personal, quickened word of God\). It may come through the Bible, a sermon, a prophecy, God speaking to our hearts, etc.

# The Principle

God may make a specific condition when He gives us the promise, but often what He requires of us is faith and patience.

> "that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those _**who through faith and patience inherit the promises**_."  
> Hebrews 6:12 NKJV

# The Problem

What God has promised may seem to be an impossible _test of faith_. God may delay giving us what He has promised. This is a _test of patience_.

# The Provision

God fulfils the promise if we will keep believing and wait for His timing.
