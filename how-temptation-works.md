# Learning Objective

* understand God's way of dealing with His people

# How Temptation Works

* God gives us a **PROMISE**
* which has with it a **PRINCIPLE** \(or condition we must fulfill\)
* and follows this by a **PROBLEM** to test/tempt us. 
* and then comes God's **PROVISION** \(if we stay faithful during the problem\)

Many of us don't have what it takes to stand in faith. We don't have the strength to fight until the victory is assured; to pray until the promise is procured; to strive until the race is won; to praise until the garment of heaviness is lifted; to live in purity; and to abstain from the accursed materials.

Temptation asks questions of our faith in Christ and to what extent we trust in Jesus \(John 14:1, Ps. 62:8\). Many of us will be tempted to give up a prayer topic when victory seems long in coming. We are tempted to search for alternatives\(Gen. 16:2\) when God's promise tarries beyond our threshold of waiting. Temptation aims at weakening the pace of our faith life. Temptation seeks to muzzle us from singing the songs of deliverance; the songs of the Lord.

Through temptation what we lack in ability, might, strength, faith and the fruits of the Spirit is gradually introduced to us. We are blessed with every spiritual blessing in heaven, but their materialization comes in phases. This is, by no means, the exhaustive list of the benefits of temptation.

The manifold and infinite wisdom of God measures just what we can bear. This means every test is a stepping stone to the next level of our faith. Thus, temptation provides a suitable occasion for gauging our ability, might, power, strength and faith. When we stand firm in the test, just like father Abraham, our strength is made clear to us. We become convinced of the power of God in our lives. When we fail in the test our lack of strength is made apparent to ourselves. To fall to pieces in the time of crisis shows that there wasn't much to us in the first place -- "_If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small_." Proverbs 24:10.

It's my prayer that we'll all become familiar with God's ways of dealing with us.

# The Promise

The **Promise** is a '_rhema_' \(a personal, quickened word of God\).

Define "promise":

* word of honour, word, assurance, pledge, vow, guarantee, oath, bond, agreement, commitment, contract, covenant.

A promise is a commitment of a future blessedness.

#### Examples of the Rhema Word

* Elisha prophesies an economic turnaround
  > "Then Elisha said, “**Hear the word of the Lord**. Thus says the Lord: ‘Tomorrow about this time a seah of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.’ ”  
  > 2 Kings 7:1 NKJV
* Mary receives a prophecy that she will carry the Christ of God
  > "And behold, **you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son**, and shall call His name Jesus."  
  > Luke 1:31 NKJV

God gives a promise of healing, salvation, peace, life, etc.

#### Sources of God's Promise

It may come through the Bible, a sermon, a prophecy, God speaking to our hearts, etc.

# The Principle

God may make a specific condition when He gives us the promise, but often what He requires of us is **faith** and **patience**.

> "that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those _**who through faith and patience inherit the promises**_."  
> Hebrews 6:12 NKJV

# The Problem

What God has promised may seem to be an impossible _test of faith_. God may delay giving us what He has promised. This is a _test of patience_.

# The Provision

God fulfils/provides the promise if we will **keep believing** and **wait** for His timing.

Define "provision"

* the action of providing or supplying something for use.

# Summary

* receive the **Promise**
* understand the **principle**
* standing in the **problem**
* entering the **provision**

2. When it comes to the promises of God the only way to obtain the provision is to trust and obey. It's really true that there is no other way but to _**trust and obey**_!

3. No one whose hope is in God will ever be put to shame. 

4. If we count our wilderness experience as pleasurable and necessary our Christian experience will allow us to account for every difficulty as joyful. "Count it all joy!"

# Prayer

1. Father, increase our threshold of waiting. Teach us to wait patiently and not lose heart.
