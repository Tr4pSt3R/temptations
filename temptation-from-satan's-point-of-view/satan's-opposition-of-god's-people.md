# Learning Objectives

* understand that God sets the limits of Satan's trials

# Introduction

Satan is opposed to God's people and therefore wants Christian to fall into sin. It is _essential_ to note that Satan is only God's instrument and can do only what God allows him to e.g. Satan has to ask God's permission about the trials he brought Job into \(Job 2, 3\).

# Limits of Trials

God sets the limits of the trials Satan brings. As we mature in the Christian life, we face more difficult temptations than we did at the beginning.

> "No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but **God is faithful**, who _will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able\(dunamai\)_, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, _that you may be able to bear it._"  
> 1 Corinthians 10:13 NKJV

The limits are based on the saint's ability\(might, power, strength\) to bear the temptation.

# Temptation through Suffering

Satan tempts us through suffering. The adversity of Satan is often pressed home at an opportune time, consequently he seeks advantage in the midst of unfortunate circumstances.

> "Now when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from Him until an opportune time."  
> Luke 4:13 NKJV

The early Christians \(and some Christians today\) faced temptations from Satan.

> "Do not fear any of those things which you are about to **suffer**. Indeed, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life."  
> Revelation 2:10 NKJV

Early Christians usually faced imprisonment for their faith in Christ.

* Peter and James Arrested
  > "And they laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening."  
  > Acts 4:3 NKJV
* Paul and Silas  
  &gt; "And when they had laid many stripes on them, **they threw them into prison**, commanding the jailer to keep them securely."   
  Acts 16:23 NKJV

## Etymology of Suffering

Suffering has its roots in the Latin word _sufferre._ It's a conjunction of two words: _sub-_ **"from below"**_ \_and \_ferre_ **"to bear"**. The word suffering can be transliterated as _**load-bearing**_**.**

## The Desires of the Flesh

Satan tempts the saints of God to satisfy natural desires in the wrong way. 

> "**1** Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. **2** And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward _He was hungry_. **3** Now when the tempter came to Him, he said, “If You are the Son of God, **command that these stones become bread**.” **4** But He answered and said, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.’ ”  
> Matthew 4:1-4 NKJV

In this passage, Satan is denoted as "_the devil_" and "_the tempter_"_._

Jesus, being fully man yet fully God, felt the pangs of hunger. He required spiritual nourishment to sustain Him. Food solves the sufferings incurred by hunger. 

Question: Why would it have been wrong for Jesus to do what Satan suggested he should do?

* Jesus would have been using His own powers rather than relying on God. 
  > "Now when the tempter came to Him, he said, “If You are the Son of God, **command that these stones become bread**.”  
  > Matthew 4:3

  * _Question_: Why is it wrong to rely on ourselves rather than God?

  * The saints of God are largely sustained by God's provision. 
  * The spiritual life of the saint of God is maintained/sustained by God's word. 
* Jesus would have been adjudged to be putting God to the test.
