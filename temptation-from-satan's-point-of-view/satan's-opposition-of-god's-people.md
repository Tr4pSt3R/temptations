# Learning Objectives

* understand that God sets the limits of Satan's trials

# Introduction

Satan is opposed to God's people and therefore wants Christian to fall into sin. It is _essential_ to note that Satan is only God's instrument and can do only what God allows him to e.g. Satan has to ask God's permission about the trials he brought Job into \(Job 2, 3\).

# Limits of Trials

God sets the limits of the trials Satan brings. As we mature in the Christian life, we face more difficult temptations than we did at the beginning.

> "No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but **God is faithful**, who _will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able\(dunamai\)_, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, _that you may be able to bear it._"  
> 1 Corinthians 10:13 NKJV

The limits are based on the saint's ability\(might, power, strength\) to bear the temptation.

# Temptation through Suffering

Satan tempts us through suffering. The adversity of Satan is often pressed home at an opportune time, consequently he seeks advantage in the midst of unfortunate circumstances.

> "Now when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from Him until an opportune time."  
> Luke 4:13 NKJV

The early Christians \(and some Christians today\) faced temptations from Satan.

> "Do not fear any of those things which you are about to **suffer**. Indeed, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life."  
> Revelation 2:10 NKJV

Early Christians usually faced imprisonment for their faith in Christ.

* Peter and James Arrested
  > "And they laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening."  
  > Acts 4:3 NKJV
* Paul and Silas  
  &gt; "And when they had laid many stripes on them, **they threw them into prison**, commanding the jailer to keep them securely."   
  Acts 16:23 NKJV

## Etymology of Suffering

Suffering has its roots in the Latin word _sufferre._ It's a conjunction of two words: _sub-_ **"from below"**_ \_and \_ferre_ **"to bear"**. The word suffering can be transliterated as _**load-bearing**_**.**
