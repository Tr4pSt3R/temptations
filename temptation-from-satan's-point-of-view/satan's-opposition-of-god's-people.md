> James 1:12 NKJV

# Learning Objectives

* understand that God sets the limits of Satan's trials
* gain a clearer understanding of what it means to suffer
* explain how the natural desire of the flesh can be compromised

# Introduction

Satan is opposed to God's people and therefore wants Christian to fall into sin. It is _essential_ to note that Satan is only God's instrument and can do only what God allows him to e.g. Satan has to ask God's permission about the trials he brought Job into \(Job 2, 3\). Spiritual warfare is the reality in the life of every born-again Christian.

# Limits of Trials

God sets the limits of the trials Satan brings. As we mature in the Christian life, we face more difficult temptations than we did at the beginning.

> "No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but **God is faithful**, who _will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able\(dunamai\)_, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, _that you may be able to bear it._"  
> 1 Corinthians 10:13 NKJV

The limits are set at the saint's ability\(might, power, strength\) to bear the temptation. The measure of the limit is based on God's evaluation as man's evaluation of himself is either inflated by pride or deflated by lack of confidence.

## Etymology of Suffering

Suffering has its roots in the Latin word _sufferre._ It's a conjunction of two words: _sub-_ **"from below"**_ \_and \_ferre_ **"to bear"**. The word suffering can be transliterated as _**load-bearing**_**.**

# Temptation through Suffering

Satan tempts us through suffering. The adversity of Satan is often pressed home at an opportune time, consequently the devil seeks advantage in the midst of unfortunate circumstances.

> "Now when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from Him until an opportune time."  
> Luke 4:13 NKJV

The early Christians \(and some Christians today\) faced temptations from Satan.

> "Do not fear any of those things which you are about to **suffer**. Indeed, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life."  
> Revelation 2:10 NKJV

Early Christians usually faced imprisonment for their faith in Christ.

* Peter and James Arrested
  > "And they laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening."  
  > Acts 4:3 NKJV
* Paul and Silas  
  > "And when they had laid many stripes on them, **they threw them into prison**, commanding the jailer to keep them securely."  
  > Acts 16:23 NKJV

## The Desires of the Flesh

Satan tempts the saints of God to satisfy natural desires in the wrong way.

> "**1** Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. **2** And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward _He was hungry_. **3** Now when the tempter came to Him, he said, “If You are the Son of God, **command that these stones become bread**.” **4** But He answered and said, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.’ ”  
> Matthew 4:1-4 NKJV

In this passage, Satan is denoted as "_the devil_" and "_the tempter_"_._

Jesus, being fully man yet fully God, felt the pangs of hunger. He required spiritual nourishment to sustain Him. Food solves the sufferings incurred by hunger.

Question: Why would it have been wrong for Jesus to do what Satan suggested he should do?

* Jesus would have been using His own powers rather than relying on God.

  > "Now when the tempter came to Him, he said, “If You are the Son of God, **command that these stones become bread**.”  
  > Matthew 4:3

  * _Question_: Why is it wrong to rely on ourselves rather than God?

  * The saints of God are largely sustained by God's provision.

  * The spiritual life of the saint of God is maintained/sustained by God's word.

* Jesus would have been adjudged to be putting God to the test.

# Painting A False Picture

Satan tempts through painting a false picture of what God is like.

> "**1** Now the serpent\(Satan\) was more cunning\(subtle, skilled in deceit\) than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said to the woman, “_Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?” _**2** And the woman\(Eve\) said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden; **3** but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die.’ ”**4** Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. **5** For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”  
> Genesis 3:1-5 NKJV

In order to paint a false picture about a person there are key areas that usually comes under attack. These areas include the person under attack's character, motives, intelligence, emotional state and authority. Satan attacked God's character by expressing God as a power-hungry control freak. God in the mind of Eve appeared to be a domineering and tyrannical figure. Satan has continued to use this tactic successfully in God's people. Apostle Paul in writing to the Corinthian church warns them of this very issue.

> "But I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ."  
> 2 Corinthians 11:3 NKJV

Satan tempts us through suffering. In other words, he creates a situation where we are torn between contradicting desires; the desire to obey God or desire to disobey God's commandment. This becomes an unbearable suffering if we have developed a desire for the object of temptation. How should we react to restrictions put in place by God's commandments? These commandments are boundaries never to crossed. What happens when we step out of the safety of God's commandments? We enter into temptation when we enter into negotiations with the serpent. The moment Eve replied with "God said..."\(Gen. 3:2,3\) the enemy took every opportunity to exploit the gaps in her knowledge. Eve's incorrect recall of the direct commandment invited Satan to act as a subject matter expert who will provide the missing picture. Although, the bulk of God's commands was left intact the small infusion made by Satan was an exceptionally toxic poison. A small yeast that marred the whole dough. We've entered into temptation when negotiation alternative means of satisfying our desires. We enter temptation when we consider the benefit of fulfilling the desire. We've entered into temptation when we calculate how much we can get away with. We've entered into temptation when God is the least of our concerns; the fear of God vanishes \(Rom. 3:8\). 

**Question**:

* What apparently good things did Satan tell Eve that God was stopping her from enjoying?
* What things may Satan be trying to convince us that God is stopping us from enjoying? 
* Have you been given a wrong impression of who God is? 
* How did you feel or react when you came to understand and know the true God for yourself?

# Reaction and Reward

Our reaction to temptation determines whether temptation works for our good or for our harm.

**Questions**:

* From the study so far, pick out the three main benefits that we gain when we come through temptation victoriously.  
  i. the crown of life

* If a man does yield to temptation and sin, what wages does he earn?

  > "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."  
  > Romans 6:23 NKJV
