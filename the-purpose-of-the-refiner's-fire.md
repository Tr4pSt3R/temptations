# Reaction and Reward

## Introduction

The purpose of the refiner's fire is for the purification of the saints. This is part of the agreement that God has made in the new covenant with all believers.

* Christ gives Himself as a sacrificial lamb and the penitent sinner offers himself as a living sacrifice
  > "who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself His own special people, _**zealous for good works**_."  
  > Titus 2:14 NKJV

This is a process that God expects His children to be willing partakers of.

* to share in Christ's suffering in order to share in His glory.
  > "and if children, then heirsâ€”heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, **if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together**."  
  > Romans 8:17 NKJV

All the tests of God aims at the bountiful flourishing and multiplication of the fruit of the Spirit. Today, we will look at the virtue of patience.

## Growing Pains

Through testing, God strengthens our patience and makes us mature.

### What is Patience?

#### Patience Defined

Patience is the capacity to accept or tolerate delay, problems, or suffering without becoming annoyed or anxious.

In situations where patience is required we can become annoyed, anxious, fretful, withdrawn, disinterested, heavy-burdened, etc. This is commonly known as a "testing time" or "a time of testing".

In our previous examples we looked at how the patriarch Abraham and the children of Israel were tested. Abraham received a promise concerning the birth of Isaac. In their time of waiting, Sarah persuaded Abraham to have a child with Hagar. This is an act of impatience. They had become anxious in their time of testing. By the reason of their advanced age they grew anxious.

Similarly, in the wilderness the children of Israel became annoyed about the lack of food. God provided bread from Heaven. The provision came with special instructions. The children of Israel couldn't bear to think that they may have to wait just as long the next time for more food. They gathered more than what was needed because, they had no capacity for delay nor could they tolerate God's timing. 

> God acts in His own time and in His own way.

### Testing Times

We profit from trials when we continue to love God "through the fire". This was the case with This is continuing act of loving God through the good times and the bad times is the biblical understanding of the virtue of patience.

We can derive great benefits from horrible situations.

> "**2** My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, **3** knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience."  
> James 1:2-3 NKJV

The trials we will consider is the sought that requires patient continuance i.e. trusting in God above all else. The Apostle James here in James 1:2 is asking us to reshape our thinking concerning the source of joy. We have often associated joy exclusively as the product of happy circumstances, pleasant treatments, comfortable financial situations, perfect health etc. The challenge remains inherently in the negative occurrences of everyday life. 

One thing that challenges believers all over the world is the act of waiting. It's my prayer that we will all have this knowledge that _the testing of our faith produces patience_. 

The act of patient is described with several Scriptural words such as:

* waiting
* tarrying
* endurance
* perseverance

Waiting upon God for an answer to prayer offers many good examples of when our patience will be tested. These are some limited examples of some situations we may well face. 

* the challenge to continue in prayer
  * Jesus, knowing the possibility of failure in the faith of the Apostles, encouraged them with a parable.
  * > "Then He spoke a parable to them, that men always ought to pray and not lose heart,"
    > Luke 18:1 NKJV

* praying for a partner i.e. wife/husband, competent business partner etc.
  * **enduring** months or years of loneliness _**until**_ God's choice comes through.
  * Esau's chose to marry foreign wives against the advice of his parents 
  * impatience will say, "any man will do", "any woman will do" etc.
  * waiting for God's choice of partner has a sure reward
* praying for dominion over a particular sin
* * praying for exaltation from a lowly estate

  > "All those who see me ridicule Me; they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trust in the LORD, let him rescue Him; let Him deliver Him, since He delights in Him!"  
  > Psalm 22:7-8 NKJV

  * our enemies take advantage of our distressing situation to prize us away from holding on to God. This is a challenge to **Abiding Faith**[^2]
  * this is a scene from the crucifixion of Christ
  * crucible, Latin root "crux", "cruc-" cross
  * this is the time of carrying our cross
  * NOTE: Patience bears the cross of waiting, tarrying, enduring and persevering.
  * impatience despises the discipline of the cross
  * in our time of testing God will seem to be absent
  * The absence of His Presence is not a sign of rejection. _During examination the teacher does not offer tuition to the student_.
  * this is God's way of testing if we will trust Him when we can't trace Him. The genuiness of our fire-tested faith sees beyond what's physically apparent.

* praying for the removal of a _thorn in the flesh_

  > "Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me."  
  > 2 Corinthians 12:8 NKJV

## Marks of Maturity

Patience has a work to do in our lives, a faith work. Believers must possess genuine faith. This is the faith that endures until the end of our days on earth. 

These are a few wonderful results from persevering in faith. 

1. Deeper conviction of the truth of the Gospel. The faith that stands[^1] is the faith that is placed in God through the sacrificial death of Christ. 
2. Faith that sees the invisible. 
3. Maturity changes our language
   * Tests of patience no longer make us miserable for even in misery we find joy.
     > "For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory," \(2 Corinthians 4:17 NKJV\)
4. When I am weak I am strong
5. When I am poor I am rich
6. Genuine Faith
   * persistent faith
   * abiding faith
   * fire-proof faith

## Prayers - Reaction and Reward - Sat. 11th February 2017

1. Lord, a time will come when our sorrows will come to an end and we will stand to inherit the crown of life. Whilst, we are in this season of refinement let Your Spirit sustain us: through the baptism of fire; through the valley of the mountain; through the parted Rea Sea; through the valleys of the shadows of death through the territories of the Moabites, through the Gentile nations etc. 

   I believe that our sorrows will soon have an end. A time will come when all the necessary exercises of purification will work patience in my midst. Let Your peace, O Jesus, flood our souls. Who alone but you can succor us when the furnace of affliction is heated seven times with hatred, oppression, mockery, scorn, false accusations, stripes, imprisonment, etc. 

   Lord, in Your passion you bore my name upon your heart. You chose to save me from the ruins of sin at all cost. Now I am yours and have become a willing partaker to Your suffering. Gird me with grace to support my weakness. I am frail, fragile and mortal. My days are numbered. Show me good in the land of the living. Will You not be glorified when my test becomes a testimony? So Lord Jesus, give me aid against my enemies and wax strong against the opponents of the Church.
