# Learning Objectives

* understand that God sets the limits of Satan's trials

# Introduction

Satan is opposed to God's people and therefore wants Christian to fall into sin. It is _essential_ to note that Satan is only God's instrument and can do only what God allows him to e.g. Satan has to ask God's permission about the trials he brought Job into \(Job 2, 3\).

# Limits of Trials

God sets the limits of the trials Satan brings. As we mature in the Christian life, why do we sometimes face more difficult temptations than we did at the beginning?

> "No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but **God is faithful**, who _will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able_, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, _that you may be able to bear it._"  
> 1 Corinthians 10:13 NKJV
