### The Need for Discernment
The whole point of discernment is to be able to distinguish between what's true and what's false. This takes training. In the field of science, computers are trained by being exposed to thousands of scenarios that forces them to make a decision. In this way they learn to remember how to make better decisions next time and how to spot incorrect patterns.
