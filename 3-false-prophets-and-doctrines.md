# Learning Objectives

 i. examine why God allowed false prophets and false doctrines

# False Prophets and Doctrines

> **1** “If there arises among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams, and he gives you a sign or a wonder,  
> **2** and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, ‘_Let us go after other gods_’—which you have not known—‘and let us serve them,’  
> **3** you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams, _for the Lord **your God is testing you** to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul._"  
> \(Deuteronomy 13:1-3, NKJV\)

## Introduction

Our study on the purpose of temptation from God's point of view has now taken a different course. A course which is rarely seen as a threat. These warnings were issued to the children of Israel but they are just as real to the Christians of Today.  
The ten commandments were given through Moses, the man of God, to the children of Israel in Exodus 20. God knows all to well that there's a difference between having a law and keeping it.

The children of Israel were tested because they made a promise to obey\(Exodus 19:8\) God's law given to them by God through Moses.

> "Then all the people answered together and said, "All that the LORD has spoken we will do." So Moses brought back the words of the people to the LORD."  
> \(Exodus 19:8 NKJV\)

The book of Deuteronomy is about the recapitulation of the ten commandments that was given to the children of Israel through their wilderness journey. Deuteronomy means the second giving of the law.

#### The Great Apostasy

> "Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times **some will depart from the faith**, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons, 2 speaking lies in hypocrisy, **having their own conscience seared with a hot iron**,"  
> \(1 Timothy 4:1, 2 NKJV\)

Define:

* doctrine

  * > a belief or set of beliefs held and taught by a Church, political party, or other group:
  * > "of the doctrine of _baptisms_, of _laying on of hands_, of _resurrection of the dead_, and of _eternal judgment_." \(Hebrews 6:2 NKJV\)

* prophet

  * ordained to speak God's word
    > **5** Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations.”  
    > **9** Then the Lord put forth His hand and touched my mouth, and the Lord said to me: “_Behold, I have put My words in your mouth_."

* dreamer of dreams

  * dreams are channels for divine revelation
  * the source of the divine flow can be either good or bad

* sign

  * thesaurus: _omen_, _signal_, _evidence_
  * predictions

* wonder
  * a supernatural occurrence i.e. a miracle
* gods

Qu. 1\) What makes a prophet false?

* a prophet who is **not** sent by God 
  > "I have **not** sent these prophets, yet they ran. I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied." \(Jeremiah 23:21 NKJV\)
* a prophet who does **not** live according to the law of God
  > "For both prophet and priest are profane; yes, in my house I have found their wickedness," says the LORD" \(Jeremiah 23:11 NKJV\)
* a prophet whose predictions do **not** come from God even, if they come to pass
  > "And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria: _they prophesied by Baal_ and caused My people Israel to err." \(Jeremiah 23:13 NKJV\)

Qu. 2\) What makes a doctrine false?

* teachings designed to deny the truth of God's word
  > "Then the serpent said to the woman, "_You will not surely die_.""  
  > \(Genesis 3:4 NKJV\)

We can expect tests from things that will take away our service to God. This is a test. The most simple of these being our attitude to attending the place of worship when the weather is cold. Do we use the weather as an excuse to stay at home and watch our favourite TV programme or do you brave the cold as true soldiers of faith?  
Finding excuses are easy since there are so many of them. False prophets are permitted to operate by God. If a half-hearted is looking for a word to soothe an accusing conscience he or she will find one in the mouth of a false prophet. You will enter temptation the minute you swallow up the lie. You may have relief momentarily from the chaos of conscience but soon enough your loyalty will become divided. This is no different to the scene in the garden.

> "Adam was not deceived, but the woman _being deceived_, fell into transgression."  
> \(1 Timothy 2:14 NKJV\)

Notes

* the anointing teaches you all things
* you have no need that anyone should teach you
* will you put God first?
* even if what they say comes to pass it's still to be classified as a lying wonder and a lying sign!

When we do not love God with all our heart and with all our soul there will be gaps for the enemy to exploit/attack!

* this will present severe challenges in the Christian's faith
* a house divided cannot stand, this is also the case with the heart.
* the core of our being must be wholly devoted to God 

### Monotheism

The children of Israel were tested so that they may learn that there is only one God!

> "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one!"  
> \(Deuteronomy 6:4 NKJV\)

define "monotheism"

* the belief or teaching that there is one all-powerful God who created the world

### The Need for Discernment

God has given every Christian the gift of discernment.  
The whole point of discernment is to be able to distinguish between what's true and what's false. This takes training. In the field of science, computers are trained by being exposed to thousands of scenarios that forces them to make a decision. In this way they learn to remember how to make better decisions next time and how to spot incorrect patterns.

Although, the predictions made by the prophet may come to pass the gift of discernment can go beyond the surface and dig out the real source of the power at work. Discernment can decipher between good and evil.

> "But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses _exercised to discern both good and evil_."  
> \(Hebrews 5:14 NKJV\)

# Heathen Nations in the Promised Land

> "**20** Then the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel; and He said, “Because this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not heeded My voice,  
> **21** I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died,  
> **22** **so that through them I may test Israel**, _whether they will keep the ways of the Lord_, to walk in them as their fathers kept them, or not.”  
> \(Judges 2:20-22 NKJV\)

#### Why God allowed some heathen nations to stay in the Promised Land?

i. So that the LORD will test whether the children of Israel of obedience will _the ways of the Lord_.

* the ways of the Lord
  * this refers to the law of God

## Summary

1. God is battling for our hearts and souls.
2. Be hungry for God's word and you will lose appetite for false words and deceptive teachings

## Prayers - Falsities

1. Holy Father, let every situation we find ourselves in be a lesson to train our hearts and souls to love and obey You.
2. Spirit of Truth, fortify our hearts with the truth of Your Word so that we may stand strong on an evil day
3. Pray against defections into false religions and cults
4. Judge of all the Earth, hold us accountable to the promises of our mouths. Yet, give us the spirit of truth to stand by the words of our mouth. Remove lying spirit out of our mouth in the name of Jesus!
