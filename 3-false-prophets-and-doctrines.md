# False Prophets and Doctrines
> **1** “If there arises among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams, and he gives you a sign or a wonder, **2** and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke to you, saying, ‘_Let us go after other gods_’—which you have not known—‘and let us serve them,’ **3** you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams, _for the Lord **your God is testing you** to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul._"
(Deuteronomy 13:1-3, NKJV)

## Introduction
Our study on the purpose of temptation from God's point of view has now taken a different course. A course which is rarely seen as a threat. These warnings were issued to the children of Israel

Define:
 - prophet
 - dreamer of dreams
 - sign
 - wonder
 - gods

Qu. 1) What makes a prophet false?
Qu. 2) What makes a doctrine false?
 - designed to deny the truth of God's word (Gen. 3:4)

We can expect tests from things that will take away our service to God. This is a test. The most simple of these being our attitude to attending the place of worship when the weather is cold. Do we use the weather as an excuse to stay at home and watch our favourite TV programme or do you brave the cold as true soldiers of faith?
Finding excuses are easy since there are so many of them. 

Notes
 - the anointing teaches you all things
 - you have no need that anyone should teach you
 - will you put God first?
 - even if what they say comes to pass it's still to be classified as a lying wonder and a lying sign!

When we do not love God with all our heart and with all our soul there will be gaps for the enemy to exploit/attack!
- this will present severe challenges in the Christian's faith
- a house divided cannot stand, this is also the case with the heart.
- the core of our being must be wholly devoted to God 

### The Need for Discernment
The whole point of discernment is to be able to distinguish between what's true and what's false. This takes training. In the field of science, computers are trained by being exposed to thousands of scenarios that forces them to make a decision. In this way they learn to remember how to make better decisions next time and how to spot incorrect patterns.



## Prayers - Falsities 
1. Holy Father, let every situation we find ourselves in be a lesson

### Notable Topics
