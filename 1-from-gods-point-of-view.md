# The Purpose of Temptation - From God’s Point of View
## Introduction
God allows us to be tempted because He loves us. This statement captures the essence of a working Father and child relationship. Of all the promises of blessings that we have received in the Bible, although this one is hard to hear for us who flee at the sight of any trouble yet it is the most assuring that God is committed to the prosperity of His children. I do not mean prosperity in the financial sense alone. The Father's interest in our individual lives has a far more comprehensive coverage than that. 

You may be asking yourself why will God tempt someone?
Surely if you are tempting someone it is because you desire their downfall? This is not the case with God, God tempts no man (James 1:13). 

Tests and temptations are used interchangeably in the Solid Foundations workbook. This is also the case in the Bible. 

First, know that God does not restrict or resist the rise of temptations against and within a believer  — “Outside were conflicts, inside were fears.”(2 Cor. 7:5b)

Temptation is putting someone to the test.
  - from Satan’s point of view:
     — design: leads to disobedience against God 
  - from God’s point of view: 
     — design: leads to either success or failure
       - the tests is for our obedience. 
       - How do we know that we are obedient to God unless we are tested?
       - Homework: READ Deut. 8:11-20)
       - you can fool a man but you can’t fool God
       - this is why God comes in with these tests
       - God’s intentions are always good, no evil! (Jer. 29:11)

### Define Temptation
> A strong urge, seduction or desire that leads to sin.

 - it’s clear that God will not command us to break the laws He has solemnly ordained
 - temptation is always connected with desire

The Lord tests the righteous 
   - “The Lord tests the righteous.” (Ps. 11:5a NKJV)
   - 
   - The Lord also allows us to be tested.
   - When we speak of God testing us a natural reaction of fear is evoked (Exo. 20:18-20) but, God’s plans is emphatically positive (Jer. 29:11)                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

## The Test Of Faith and Obedience

### Introduction
God puts us in situations which allows Him, ourselves and others to see what is in our hearts. 

Faith without works is dead. In fact it cannot be called faith. As a new creation in Christ God will test our faith, love, obedience and reverential fear of Him. God is always faithful, but we are not always faithful. This is our problem.

How can we trust God in all circumstances? How can we demonstrate our love towards God even in the face of trials?
