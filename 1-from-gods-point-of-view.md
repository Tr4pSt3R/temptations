# The Purpose of Temptation - From God’s Point of View
## Introduction
God allows us to be tempted because He loves us. This statement captures the essence of a working Father and child relationship. Of all the promises of blessings that we have received in the Bible, although this one is hard to hear for us who flee at the sight of any trouble yet it is the most assuring that God is committed to the prosperity of His children. I do not mean prosperity in the financial sense alone. The Father's interest in our individual lives has a far more comprehensive coverage than that. 

You may be asking yourself why will God tempt someone?
Surely if you are tempting someone it is because you desire their downfall? This is not the case with God, God tempts no man (James 1:13). 

Tests and temptations are used interchangeably in the Solid Foundations workbook. This is also the case in the Bible. 

First, know that God does not restrict or resist the rise of temptations against and within a believer  — “Outside were conflicts, inside were fears.”(2 Cor. 7:5b)

Temptation is putting someone to the test.
  - from Satan’s point of view:
     — design: leads to disobedience against God 
  - from God’s point of view: 
     — design: leads to either success or failure
       - the tests is for our obedience. 
       - How do we know that we are obedient to God unless we are tested?
       - Homework: READ Deut. 8:11-20)
       - you can fool a man but you can’t fool God
       - this is why God comes in with these tests
       - God’s intentions are always good, no evil! (Jer. 29:11)

### Define Temptation
> A strong urge, seduction or desire that leads to sin.

 - it’s clear that God will not command us to break the laws He has solemnly ordained
 - temptation is always connected with desire

The Lord tests the righteous 
   - “The Lord tests the righteous.” (Ps. 11:5a NKJV)
   - 
   - The Lord also allows us to be tested.
   - When we speak of God testing us a natural reaction of fear is evoked (Exo. 20:18-20) but, God’s plans is emphatically positive (Jer. 29:11)                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

## The Test Of Faith and Obedience

### Introduction
God puts us in situations which allows Him and us and others to see what is in our hearts.

Faith without works is dead. In fact it cannot be called faith. As a new creation in Christ God will test your faith, love and obedience. God is faithful but are we faithful? How can we trust God in all circumstances? How can we demonstrate our love towards God even in the face of trials?

Faith can be found in the heart (Rom. 10:8, 9).
  - desire and faith dwells in the heart

Situations:
  - can be brief in duration
  - can be limited to a certain date
  - can be protracted and without a defined end 

Examples of God’s Testing:
  i. Abraham’s faith confirmed (Gen. 22:1-18)

Example 1: Abraham’s Faith Confirmed
a. What was the test that Abraham’s covenant God put him through?
b. What was Hashem’s reason for doing it?
  — “for now I know that you fear God,” Gen. 22:12
c. What was the wonderful result for the patriarch Abraham?
   — blessing I will bless you
   — multiplying I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven and the sand which is on the seashore
   — and your descendants shall possess the gates of their enemies
   — in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed

NOTES: 
  - God’s demand that Abraham offer Isaac is unlike anything in the ancient world
  - Abraham would not have considered this command of God commonplace
  - no offence is identified as a reason for the sacrifice (I would have protested it as unfair!)

## Questions

1. What happens when a believer does not react well to a temptation i.e. are overcome by a temptation?
  — there’s a rise of remorseful emotion (2 Cor. 7:9)
  — over-taken by godly sorrow (2 Cor. 7:9)
  — repentance from the LORD must be sought after
